High-Frequency Oscillator Architectures
Research Internship at IIT Roorkee
Mentor: Dr. Sudeb Dasgupta

Overview
This repository showcases the work carried out during my research internship at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, focused on the design, analysis, and implementation of high-frequency oscillators using Cadence Virtuoso.

Project Objective
